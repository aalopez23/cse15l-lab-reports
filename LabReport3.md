# Week 3 Lab Report

## LESS COMMAND
? or --help
              
              This option displays a summary of the commands accepted by
              less.  

-c or --clear-screen
             
              Causes full screen repaints to be painted from the top
              line down. Are done by scrolling from the bottom of screen
d or --dumb
             
             The -d option does not show the error message normally
              if the terminal lacks some
              important capability, such as the ability to clear the
              screen or scroll backward.  


## GREP COMMAND

i, --ignore-case

              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so
              that characters that differ only in case match each other.

-H, --with-filename

              Print the file name for each match.  This is the default
              when there is more than one file to search.  
              
n, --line-number

              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number
              within its input file.


## FIND COMMAND

-p 

              When find examines or prints information about
              files, and the file is a symbolic link, the information
              used shall be taken from the properties of the
              link itself.

-l  

               When find examines or prints
              information about files, the information used shall be
              taken from the properties of the file to which the link
              points, not from the link itself.
              
H- 

              When find examines or prints
              information about files, the information used shall be
              taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.
              The only exception to this behaviour is when a file
              specified on the command line is a symbolic link, and the
              link can be resolved.
